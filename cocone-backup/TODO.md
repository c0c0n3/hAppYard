VM templates
============
currently `/Volumes/data/VMs/templates/` is not backed up anywhere; its contents
(the `win7-base` VM) used to be backed up in Dropbox.
Decide what to do with this big honking directory (~8.1G): do I still need it?
If so I should decide in which Google drive to put it and add it to the back up
configuration.
